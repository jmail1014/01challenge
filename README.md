# Challenge 01 - Horiseon Website - Refactor

The purpose of this challenge was to refactor an exsiting sites code to help accessability. The code was refactored and made to be more semantic. 

## Description

The Horiseon website now meets accessibility standards with sematic code. 

* Websites title was changed to be more descriptive of the website. 
* Alt attributes were added to the 6 images, with # since they were all icons and fit the descriptive text as decoration so did not need to be further described. 
* Html structure was changed from divs to more sematic elements like header, footer, nav, aside and main. 
** Remaining divs were changed to sections.
* Heading tags where change to be in sequential order (h2 at the footer was changed to h3). 
* Html class names were condensed to house multiple elements with the same css rules. 

* In Css the html structure was grouped then labeled with css comments, as well as listed in order of arrival on website.
* Combined duplicate css rules with the reworked class names, using one class selector for multiple sections of html with the same css rules.
